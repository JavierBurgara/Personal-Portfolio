        I have a strong passion for both gaming and basketball. Currently, I am
        actively engaged in the realm of competitive online gaming, particularly
        within the titles of League of Legends and Apex Legends. Moreover,
        during weekends, I participate in organized basketball leagues alongside
        a close-knit group of friends, adding an element of physical recreation
        and camaraderie to my leisure pursuits. In a recent discovery, I have
        found a profound interest in the art of coding. This newfound passion
        has significantly impacted my approach to problem-solving and my
        capacity to address various challenges, particularly those encountered
        within coding projects and during the completion of tasks within my
        coding bootcamp. It has underscored the importance of meticulous and
        strategic thinking in my problem-solving endeavors, thereby enhancing my
        capabilities in the coding domain.
